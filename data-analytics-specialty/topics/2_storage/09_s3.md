# Amazon S3

## Traits

* Same-region/cross-region replication (possible)
* 99.99999999999% durability

## Usecases

* Data-lake
* Analytics
* Data-archiving
* Static website-hosting
* ...

## Integration

* Athena - Queries S3

### Query with S3 Select

Query Functionality on top of S3.

* SelectObjectContents - SDK
  * InputType
    * SQL
* [DataFormats](10_formats.md)
  * CSV
  * JSON
  * Parquet
* Compression
  * GZIP
  * BZIP2 for CSV/JSON
  * GZIP Columnar for Parquet
* Encoding
  * UTF-8

### Storage Classes

* Standard - Frequently accessed data
* Standard IA - Long-lived, infrequently accessed (but still ms response when needed)
* Intelligent Tiering - Changing or unknown pattern
* One-Zone IA - Non-critical, infrequently accessed data (usually that can be recreated)
* Glacier - Long-term data-archiving - minutes to hours of retrieval time
* Glacier Deep Archive - Rarely accessed data - 12h+ retrieval time
* RRS - Frequently accessed non-critical data (usually that can be recreated)

#### Life-cycle Policy

* Lifecycle rules to graduate files to colder storage classes e.g.: from Standard to Glacier
* Transition always goes one-way only, from Standard -> to colder classes
* Encrypted objects remain encrypted
* Archived objects can't use life-cycle policy

## Replication

* Copies objects asynchronously across S3 buckets
* CRR - Cross Region Replication
* SRR - Same Region Replication

# EC2
> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Web Service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

## Pricing Models

* On Demand
  * Fixed rate price, no commitment
  * Applications that can't be interrupted
  * Applications with spiky traffic
* Reserved
  * Long-term commitment, cheaper prices (from 1 to 3 years)
  * Applications with steady load and expected requirements
  * Types:
    * Standard
    * Convertible - You can change over time
    * Scheduled - Specific time-window usage
* Spot
  * Enables you to bid whatever price you want for on-demand compute, if your applications have flexible start/end times.
  * Urgent compute needs
  * Applications that can be interrupted
* Dedicated Hosts
  * Physical EC2 (e.g.: for licensing purposes)
  * Regulatory needs

## Types of Instances

* F - FPGA
* I - IOPS
* G - Graphics/GPU
* H - High Disk Throughput
* T - Cheap General Purpose (t1.micro)
* D - Density
* R - RAM
* M - Main purpose
* C - Compute/CPU
* P - Graphics

* A - Arm
* U - Bare metal

## Lab

* Setup an instance (with AMS-LINUX-2)
* Allow SG to connect to SSH
* Create a SSH Public/Private Keyset
* Create instance
* Connect to the instance via SSH
* `sudo su`
* `yum update -y`
* Install apache `yum install httpd`
* Create a `/var/www/html/index.html`
* Start server `service httpd start`
* Onboot configs: `chkconfig on`
* Check public IP, e.g.: `http://35.156.91.242/index.html`

### Take-aways

* IOPS - Input/Output per second
* You are able to encrypt root devices
* EBS Backed instance is set to delete on terminate
* Other types are not automatically selected for delete on termination

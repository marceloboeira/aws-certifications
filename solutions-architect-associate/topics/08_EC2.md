# EC2
> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Web Service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

## Pricing Models

* On Demand
  * Fixed rate price, no commitment
  * Applications that can't be interrupted
  * Applications with spiky traffic
* Reserved
  * Long-term commitment, cheaper prices (from 1 to 3 years)
  * Applications with steady load and expected requirements
  * Types:
    * Standard
    * Convertible - You can change over time
    * Scheduled - Specific time-window usage
* Spot
  * Enables you to bid whatever price you want for on-demand compute, if your applications have flexible start/end times.
  * Urgent compute needs
  * Applications that can be interrupted
* Dedicated Hosts
  * Physical EC2 (e.g.: for licensing purposes)
  * Regulatory needs

## Types of Instances

* F - FPGA
* I - IOPS
* G - Graphics/GPU
* H - High Disk Throughput
* T - Cheap General Purpose (t1.micro)
* D - Density
* R - RAM
* M - Main purpose
* C - Compute/CPU
* P - Graphics
* X - Extreme Memory
* Z - Extreme Memory and CPU
* A - Arm
* U - Bare metal

## Lab

* Setup an instance (with AMS-LINUX-2)
* Allow SG to connect to SSH
* Create a SSH Public/Private Keyset
* Create instance
* Connect to the instance via SSH
* `sudo su`
* `yum update -y`
* Install apache `yum install httpd`
* Create a `/var/www/html/index.html`
* Start server `service httpd start`
* Onboot configs: `chkconfig on`
* Check public IP, e.g.: `http://35.156.91.242/index.html`

### Take-aways

* IOPS - Input/Output per second
* You are able to encrypt root devices
* EBS Backed instance is set to delete on terminate
* Other types are not automatically selected for delete on termination

## Security Groups Lab

* Whitelist based
  * All inboud in blocked by default
  * All outbout is allowed by default
* Instance Group changes take effect immediately
* Security Groups are Stateful
  * When you allow inbound rules, the outbound are set by default
* You can attach multiple security groups to a single EC2 instance

## Bootstrap Script

Using the UserData field on EC2 we can create a bootstrap script

* e.g.:
```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
checkconfig httpd on
echo "<h1>Deployed via Terraform</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
aws s3 mb s3://random-bucket-202005192224999
aws cp /var/www/html/index.html s3://random-bucket-202005192224999/index.html
```

## Meta-data

Within the AWS instance local network there is a web-server that returns the instance metadata

More info:

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address
* https://blog.gruntwork.io/authenticating-to-aws-with-instance-metadata-b6d812a86b40
* http://www.dowdandassociates.com/blog/content/howto-get-amazon-ec2-instance-metadata/

e.g.:

```
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 -> returns the IP V4
```

## EBS
> Elastic Block Store

* Persisted Block Store Volumes
* EBS is automatically replicated within the AZ
* Virtual HD
* 5 Types
  * General Purpose SSD (gp2)
    * Balance in Price and Performance
    * Up to 16k IOPS
  * Provisioned IOPS (SSD) (io1)
    * Mission critical, e.g.: Databases
    * Up to 65k IOPS
  * Throughput Optimiseed HDD (Physical Magnetic) (st1)
    * 500 IOPS
    * Big Data, Data Warehouse
  * Cold Hard-Disk Drive (Magnetic) (sc1)
    * 250 IOPS File Servers, Infrequently accessed
  * EBS Magnetic (standard)
    * 40-250 IOPS
    * Data archive?

* Your EBS volume will always be on the same AZs of the EC2 instance
* You can encrypt an existing EBS volume by creating a snapshot (copying the existing one as well)
* Snapshots are encrypted automatically
* You can share with other AWS accounts (when unencrypted)

### Moving EBS to another region

* Create a snapshot
* Create an image (from the snapshot)
* Virtualization: HVM vs PM
  * HVM the guest VM uses hardware
  * Depends on the instance type (HVM is more compatible)
* The image becomes an AMI and it can be used to deploy new instances
* Create a new AZs
* You can copy the AMI to other regions in order to launch EC2 in order Regions
* It is better to stop the instance but you can also do it with the instance running

### EBS Lab

* Create a new volume
* Attach volume to instance
* Connect to instance
* Format volume
* Mount
* Test
* More info: https://devopscube.com/mount-ebs-volume-ec2-instance/

## AMIs

* You can select AMI based on:
  * Region
  * OS
  * Architecture
  * Launch Permissions
  * Storage for Root Device
    * Instance Store (EPHEMERAL)
    * EBS Backed Volumes

#### Instance Store vs EBS

* Instance Store
  * You can add EBS volumes Later, but no Instance Store
  * You dont see the Instance Stores
  * Instance Store doesn't persist on stop (you cannot stop the instance) since it is ephemeral
  * Limit AMIs
* EBS
  * Replicated
  * You can reboot
  * It is persisted

### ENI vs ENA vs EFA

* ENI - Elastic Network Interface - network card
  * A primary IPv4 on your VPC
  * One or more secondary IPv4
  * One Elastic IP address (IPv4)
  * One public IPv4 address
  * One or more IPv6 addresses
  * One or more Security Group
  * A MAC address
  * A Source destrination check flag
  * Create dual-homed redundant workload networks
* EN - Enhanced Networking - Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV)
  * Provides SR IO Virtualization - more performance for specific supported instance types
  * More bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second) and better latency/throughput
  * No additional price, but you need to use supported instance types
  * 2 types:
    * Elastic Network Adapter:
      * up to 100 Gbps
    * Intel 82599 (Virtual Function)
      * Network interfaces up to 10 Gbps
* Elastic Fabric Adapter - Network Device to allow HPC and ML applications
  * Accelarate your network for High Performance Computing (HPC) and ML applications.
  * Its own protocol, not TCP
  * It bypasses the OS, providing great performance with low-latency (only on Linux!)

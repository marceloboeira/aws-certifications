### Structure

Each root folder is one namespace, for technology/tool specific, e.g.: `aws`, `pagerduty`, `hashicorp` and each 'certification' is composed of:
* `README.md` - With an index of important infos
* `Makefile` - to manage all operations of that repo
* `terraform/` - to practice and provision all infra required for the examples
* `topics/` - multiple notes, links, take-aways and important info on each topic covered on such certification
* `scripts/` - simple example scripts to provision or demonstrate usage of different services/components/features. Usually including companion make file aliases

If you want to use the Terraform module, make sure to install terraform and create a new AWS account.

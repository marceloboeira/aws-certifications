## Roles Practice Lab

1. Create (or re-use a role with specific permissions)
2. Attach the role to the EC2 profile
3. SSH into the EC2 instance
4. Try out experimenting all permissions (no keys or credentials needed)

* Take-aways
  * Roles can be assigned to anything
  * Roles are easier and safer to manage
